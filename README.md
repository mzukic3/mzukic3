Founded by vets, Felcana understands how monitoring a dog or cat’s activity and behaviour can help show you how healthy they are. Felcana understands that dogs and cats can’t tell you when they’re feeling ill, but their Digital Pet Health Platform can. Felcana’s first product, Felcana Go, is the only clinical-grade pet activity monitor on the market, continuously gathering high-quality activity data about your dog or cat. They use data analytics to interpret any changes in your pet’s activity and generate personalised insights about their health. Together with your vet, Felcana helps identify early signs of health problems that would otherwise be too subtle to spot, helping you to predict, simplify and treat issues sooner and more cost-effectively.
